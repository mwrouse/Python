tell the user this is program will jumble a word and ask the user to guess the word, they can get a hint but will get less points for using a hint

import ability to generate random numbers


create a sequence of words the computer can pick from, they are: phython, jumble, easy, difficult, answer, and xylophone

create a sequence of hints the computer uses for each word



set the play again variable to yes

set the score equal to 0


while the play again variable equals yes do this:
	
	set a variable that tells the program if the user has used a  hint
	
	pick a random number between 0 and 5

	get the word from the word sequence associated with that random number and set is as the variable word
	
	get the hint from the hint sequence associated with that random number and set it as the variable hint

	
	set the variable correct equal to the word variable so program remembers the word the user needs to guess

	pick a rabdom letter from the word, store it in variable jumble and do this for all the letters of the word

	
	if the score is not equal to zero then display the score beacause the user has played more than once

	display the jumbled word to the screen

	ask the user to make a guess

	if the guess does not equal the variable correct do this:
		if the guess was blank then
			tell the user the hint
		else
			tell the user the guess was incorrect
			ask the user to guess again

	if the user is corect 
		tell the user they got the word correct
		
		if the user used a hint then add 1 to score
		if the user did not use a hin then add 2 to score

	ask the user if they want to play again and save input as variable play again
