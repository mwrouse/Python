import the ability for random

create function for asking a number called ask_number:
	the code will ask a question and the user has to input a number that needs
	to be between a range defined by the programmer or the user if needed to change
	the function will be able to have a step value to count by
	

create a fucntion named main:
	tell the user the game requires them to guess a number between 1 and 100 in the least
	attempts as possible

	set a low variable to 1
	set a high variable to 100

	generate a random number between the low variable and the high variable, save as variable the_number

	do this until the user's guess is the same as the_number:
	
		ask the user for a number using the ask_number function and save it as variable guess
	
		if guess is higher than the_number tell the user it's too high
		if guess is lower than the_number tell the user it's too low


	when guess is equal to the number tell the user they guessed correctly

run the main function
