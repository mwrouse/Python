tell the user what that this program produces two random positive integers from 1 to 12, asks the user if they want new numbers; if they don't it calculates the sum of the numbers and displays it alongside the number as a number sentence, asks the user for the answer to each number sentence and tells the user if the answer was correct or not. Adds the number of correct answers and tells the user how many they got right at the end. If they got all correct tell the user a special messege.


import the random feature
set counter as 1
set correct as 0
set wrong as 0

set userAnswer as "no"

ask the user for their name and save it as variable userName

while lowercase(userAnswer) does not equal "no" or "n" do this:
	set number1 as a random number between 0 and 12
	set number2 as a random number between 0 and 12
	set numSentence1 as ""
	set numSentence2 as ""

	if number2 is the same as number 1 then
		reset number2 as a random number between 0 and 12

	if number1 is larger than number2 then	
		numSentence1 = str(number2) "+" str(number1) "="
		numSent1Ans = number2 + number1
		numSentence2 = str(number1) "+" str(number2) "="
		numSent2Ans = number1 + number
	else
		numSentence1 = str(number1) "+" str(number2) "="
		numSent1Ans = number1 + number2
		numSentence2 = str(number2) "+" str(number1) "="
		numSent2Answer = number2 + number1
	
	answer = number1 + number2

	
	if counter divided by 2 = 0 then
		ask the user to input the answer for numSentence1 as variable answer1
	else
		ask the user to input the answer for numSentence2 as variable answer1


	if answer1 is the same as answer then
		tell the user "Correct! Good Job!"
		add 1 to correct
	else
		tell the user "Sorry, the answer was actually numSent2Ans
		add 1 to wrong
	
	add 1 to counter

	ask the user if they want to change the set of numbers and save as variable userAnswer

stop while loop

if correct is the same as counter then
	tell the user Congratulations, userName! You get a GOLD STAR!"
end if

tell the user how many they got correct (variable correct)
tell the user how many they got incorrect (variable wrong)
