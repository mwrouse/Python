tell the user what that this program produces two random positive integers from 1 to 12, asks the user if they want new numbers; if they don't it calculates the sum of the numbers and displays it alongside the number as a number sentence, asks the user for the answer to each number sentence


import the random feature



set userAnswer as "yes"

while lowercase(userAnswer) does not equal "no" or "n" do this:
	set number1 as a random number between 0 and 12
	set number2 as a random number between 0 and 12
	set numSentence1 as ""
	set numSentence2 as ""

	if number2 is the same as number 1 then
		reset number2 as a random number between 0 and 12


	if number1 is larger than number2 then	
		numSentence1 = str(number2) "+" str(number1)
		numSentence2 = str(number1) "+" str(number2)
	else
		numSentence1 = str(number1) "+" str(number2)
		numSentence2 = str(number2) "+" str(number1)

	ask the user to input the answer for numSentence1
	ask the user to input the answer for numSentence2

	ask the user if they want to change the set of numbers and save as variable userAnswer

stop while loop
