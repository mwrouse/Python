tell the user what that this program produces two random positive integers from 1 to 12, asks the user if they want new numbers; if they don't it calculates the sum of the numbers and displays it alongside the number as a number sentence
import the random feature

set number1 as a random number between 0 and 12
set number2 as a random number between 0 and 12

set userAnswer as "yes"

while lowercase(userAnswer) does not equal "no" or "n" do this:
	set number1 as a random number between 0 and 12
	set number2 as a random number between 0 and 12

	if number2 is the same as number 1 then
		reset number2 as a random number between 0 and 12


	if number1 is larger than number2 then	
		print number2 "+" number1 "=" the sum of number2 + number1
		print number1 "+" number2 "=" the sum of number1 + number2
	else
		print number1 "+" number2 "=" the sum of number1 + number2
		print number2 "+" number1 "=" the sum of number2 + number1

	ask the user if they want to change the set of numbers and save as variable userAnswer

stop while loop
