tell the user what that this program produces two random positive integers from 1 to 12, asks the user if they want new numbers; if they don't it calculates the sum of the numbers and displays it alongside the number as a number sentence


import the random feature


set userAnswer as "yes"

while lowercase(userAnswer) does not equal "no" or "n" do this:
	set number1 as a random number between 0 and 12
	set number2 as a random number between 0 and 12
	set numSentence1 as ""
	set numSentence2 as ""

	if number2 is the same as number 1 then
		reset number2 as a random number between 0 and 12


	if number1 is larger than number2 then	
		numSentence1 = str(number2) "+" str(number1) "=" str(number2 + number1)
		numSentence2 = str(number1) "+" str(number2) "=" str(number1 + number2)
	else
		numSentence1 = str(number1) "+" str(number2) "=" str(number1 + number2)
		numSentence2 = str(number2) "+" str(number1) "=" str(number2 + number1)

	print numSentence1 to the screen
	print numSentence2 to the screen

	ask the user if they want to change the set of numbers and save as variable userAnswer
stop while loop
