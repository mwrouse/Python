tell the user that this program is used by Donald Trump to fire someone


create a sequence of 6 employees

create a variable to tell if the user wants to fires someone else(replay) and set it to yes

if the user wants to replay do this:
	give the list of remaining employees they can fire
	
	have the user input the employee id of the person they want to fire


	remove the person based on their user id from the employee sequence

	ask if they want to fire someone else and save as variable replay

if the computer has no one else to fire then tell them good job and to fire themselves
