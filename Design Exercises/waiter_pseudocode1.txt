Approach the table.

Once at the table you introduce yourself to the table's occupants

do for every person at the table:
	ask what they would like to drink
	write down what they would like to drink

once everyone has their drinks ordered say you'll be back in a minute with the drinks

go make the drinks

bring the drinks back to the table

do for every person at the table
	if you can't remember what drink they ordered do this:
		ask them which drink they ordered
	
	hand them their drink

Once everyone at the table has their drinks ask if they are ready to order


if they are not ready to order do this:
	
	leave and come back to the table in a few minutes to see if they are ready to order


when they are ready to order do this:
	for every person at the table do this:
		ask what they would like to eat
	
		if they order a meal: ask them what side they would like
		if they order a burger: ask them what they would like on the burger
		
		if they ask any questions: answer them 
		

	After everyone has ordered be sure to read them the order back to make
	sure you got the order correct

	if the order is not correct make the changes they request

	When the order is correct tell them it will be ready shortly


	deliver the order to the cooks.


When the order is ready to be delivered:
	take the order to the table

	Do this for every person at the table:
		if you don't remember what they ordered ask them which one they ordered

		hand each person their meal


do this until they are done eating:

	Return to the table once every 10 minutes and ask how the meal is going

	when they look like they are finishing up hand them the check and tell them to have a good day and 
	to visit again
