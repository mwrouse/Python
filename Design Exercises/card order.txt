Before moving any cards, designate a location for each pile of suites for a total of four piles

pile1 is for hearts
pile2 is for clubs
pile3 is for diamonds
pile4 is for spades

For every card (52) in the deck do this:
	Look at the cards suit.

	if the card's suit is hearts then place it face down in pile1
	if the card's suit is clubs then place it face down in pile2
	if the card's suit is diamonds place it face down in pile3
	if the card's suit is spades place it face down in pile4


Once all the cards are in their pile do this:

	create a new pile for the finished deck
	
	for each pile starting with pile1 and ending with pile4 do this:
		spread the deck out so you can see each of the card's face.
		
		Pick up the king and place it face down in the new pile.
		Pick up the 10 and place it face down in that new pile.
		Pick up the 9 and place it face down in that new pile.
		Pick up the 8 and place it face down in that new pile.
		Pick up the 7 and place it face down in that new pile.
		Pick up the 6 and place it face down in that new pile.
		Pick up the 5 and place it face down in that new pile.
		Pick up the 4 and place it face down in that new pile.
		Pick up the 3 and place it face down in that new pile.
		Pick up the 2 and place it face down in that new pile.
		Pick up the ace and place it face down in that new pile.
