for every person at the table do this:
		ask what they would like to eat
	
		if they order a meal: ask them what side they would like
		if they order a burger: ask them what they would like on the burger
		
		if they ask any questions: answer them 
		

	After everyone has ordered be sure to read them the order back to make
	sure you got the order correct

	if the order is not correct make the changes they request

	When the order is correct tell them it will be ready shortly
